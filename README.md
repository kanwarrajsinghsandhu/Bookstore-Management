In this an online library for students of a college will be created, where students can issue a wide variety of books belonging to various subjects, for fixed periods of time.
Books are issued to books on the basis of their official id which is presnt with the library staff which is based on their college registration details like roll number.
In case an issued book is not returned within the fixed period of time, a fine is imposed which keeps on increasing based upon the days over the due date.
Separate accounts for library administrators and individual studentsare created with separate functions based on their roles.
The above set of php files can be viewed after directly importing them and creating a database for them on phpmyadmin.
